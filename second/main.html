			<h1>Malapot na Pininyahang Manok</h1>
			<p>Pininyahang Manok, as the name implies, relies largely on the strong flavor of our yellow fruit to enrich a yummy chicken dish. But this hero ingredient also relies massively on many other components to complete it. We have the likes of garlic, carrots and bell peppers. </p>

			<h1>Chicken Barbecue</h1>

			<p>In my experience, this is the kind of dish that you will definitely want to go back to again and again. There used to be an entire stretch of ihawan or food vendors that grill food in Las Piñas, specifically right along Zapote. If I recall correctly, there were more than 20 stalls right on that stretch. Given the number of stalls, you could probably tell how much Filipinos love to eat their grilled food.</p>

			<h1>Sinigang Mix Inasal na Manok</h1>

			<p>This delicious chicken dish, which famously originated in the City of Bacolod, is well-known in the Philippines. Various restaurants fight over having the best Chicken Inasal, and customers often end up eating heaps of rice alongside one serving of chicken. But the word, itself, makes it sound very simple as a dish.</p>
